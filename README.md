# Research and Reading
The purpose of this repository is to track my learning outside the settings of classes and specific research projects to get a broad sense of where my interests lie. I find independent learning to be invaluable as it is not constrained by curriculae, time, or necessity; it is an unimpeded flow of interest. In this sense, it is a natural process to identify what I wish to spend my life studying. Additionally, it is a useful way to organize my notes and return to problems as their results become useful. 

I have generally structured the repository by resource, so that each book–or other resource–gets its own directory which contains relevant work I have done. I have, in most cases, further structured these directories by chapter. In the interest of tracking which interests led where, I will give a brief description of why I read which books, and what I have learned.

Emmy Noether's Wonderful Theorem (Neuenschwander): This book was recomended to me by my Algebra Professor, Mike Siddoway. So far, it has been an extension of my Classical Mechanics class, with a fairly mathematical view on many of those topics, and the introduction of invariance and Noether's Theorem, which we did not get to in Mechanics. It also has included some variational problems outside of Classical Mechanics, and later chapters build on these results in the theory of fields.

Modern Classical Mechanics (Helliwell and Sahakian): This was the classical mechanics book I used. We never got to the Hamiltonian formalism, and as it is important for plasma physics, I worked through it. A few of the later chapters look quite interesting as well, including the chapter one rotational mechanics, which I started, but have not gotten back to.

Fundamentals of Plasma Physics (Bellan): I would like to have a more general knowledge of plasma physics for the research I have been doing with Dr. Adam Light on atmospheric plasmas. As Colorado College does not have a plasma physics course, I ordered this textbook, and have been working through it. I am getting much better at thinking about plasmas, and have started working on some numerical tecniques which I hope will allow me to take my research in a more theoretical direction.
